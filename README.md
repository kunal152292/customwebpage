# customwebpage
In this project I was given a challenge to build a pixel perfect website as per the design given by the user.
The website should change its look when opened from a mobile device.
The list of menu present in the desktop browser should be converted to an icon of menu in the top left corner which should be responsive
The placement of the sections should change. It took me 6 hours to complete this project.
